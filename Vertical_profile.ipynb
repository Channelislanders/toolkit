    "#### Overview of Amazon Web Services (AWS)\n",
    "`Amazon Web Services (AWS)` is a comprehensive and widely adopted cloud platform that offers over 200 fully-featured services from data centers globally. `AWS` provides a variety of services including computing power, storage, and databases, which can be scaled up or down depending on the user’s needs. These services help organizations lower their IT costs, improve performance, and innovate faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "`AWS` is widely used across industries such as healthcare, finance, retail, and education due to its reliability, flexibility, and comprehensive suite of tools and services. This makes it an excellent choice for businesses looking to leverage cloud computing to enhance their operations and innovation capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Overview of Xarray and APIs\n",
    "`Xarray` is a powerful Python library for handling multi-dimensional arrays, often used in atmospheric, oceanographic, and climate sciences. It provides a high-level API for managing labeled data, making it easy to perform complex operations on large datasets. Here is a link that details what xarrays are and how you can manipulate [them](https://earth-env-data-science.github.io/lectures/xarray/xarray_intro.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "`APIs` (Application Programming Interfaces) allow different software applications to communicate with each other. In the context of data science, APIs provide access to various datasets and services over the internet, enabling seamless data retrieval and manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will guide you through using Xarray and other libraries to analyze climate data from the CESM1 Large Ensemble dataset."

Since it is hosted on Amazon Web services, the users accessing this data will not have to create a separate account. More information on the details of this dataset can be found [here](https://ncar.github.io/cesm-lens-aws/) which is also briefly discussed below. Directions will be followed very similarly to a NCAR repository labeled [CESM LENS on AWS](https://github.com/NCAR/cesm-lens-aws).\n",
